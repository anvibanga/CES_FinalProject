# Creative Embedded Systems Final Project

For our final project, we decided to create a user-controlled hypnosis wheel.

Materials Used:
- 2 ESP32 TTGO T-displays
- 1 28BYJ-48 Step Motor
- 1 button
- Cardboard box
- Cup
- Printout of hypnosis wheel
- Lots of tapeâ€¦ 

Our hypnosis wheel consisted of 2 ESP32s, one connected to a button, and one connected to a stepper motor. Once the button is pressed, the first ESP32 broadcasts a message to the second one, and the second one spins the motor that has the wheel attached.
